# odin-recipes
Simple website showing a few recipes. Idea behind this 
website is to practice mastering basic html skills that 
have been learned through the Odin Project course.

Likely will create an index page and an about page. The 
pages will likely have a combination links both absolute 
and the other one. Will use different paragraphs headers. 
Likely will incorporate images and both ordered and 
unordered lists.
